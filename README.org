#+TITLE: shell-pwd

This package can display shell working directory in a buffer name. To enable
just add ~shell-pwd-enable~ to ~shell-mode-hook~:

~(add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'shell-pwd-enable)~
* Customization
You can customize how new buffer name is chosen through
~shell-pwd-generate-buffer-name-function~. Set to it your custom function. This
function should take a string as an argumnt and return a string. The resulting
string will be used as new buffer name.

If you like the default name generating function, but you don't want directory
path to be shortened, set ~shell-pwd-shorten-directory~ to nil.
* Note
  This won't work without dirtrack enabled.

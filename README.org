#+TITLE: shell-pwd

[[shell-pwd-scrot.png]]

This package can display shell working directory in a buffer name.  To enable
just add ~shell-pwd-enable~ to ~shell-mode-hook~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'shell-pwd-enable)
#+end_src

*OR*

Just call ~shell-pwd-shell~.  It calls ~shell~ with /shell-pwd/ set correctly.
The purpose of this command is to replace ~M-x shell~, because, maybe, you don't
want to enable /shell-pwd/ in ~project-shell~.

* Additional commands
  - shell-pwd-list-buffers :: List shells in ibuffer.  Exit or select will
    automaticall kill ibuffer buffer.
  - shell-pwd-change-directory :: While in shell-mode buffer, you can call this
    command to interactively change directory in shell.

* Customization
  You can customize how new buffer name is chosen by creating an ~:override~
  advice for ~shell-pwd-generate-buffer-name~ function.  This function should
  take a directory string as an argumnt and return a string.  The resulting
  string will be used as new buffer name.

* Note
  This won't work without /dirtrack/ enabled for shell.
